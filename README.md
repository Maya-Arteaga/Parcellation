Parcellation and Sampling: An Examination at Mesoscopic and Microscopic Levels

This project aims to address the unbiased identification of regions of interest by applying computational algorithms to images obtained through microscopy using 10x objectives. Subsequently, microscopic-level sampling is conducted using 40x objectives using the MorphoGlia tool.

Here, we are implementing the HDBSCAN algorithm on images. To achieve this, it is necessary to convert the images into numpy arrays to utilize this clustering method, and then reconvert these arrays back into images while preserving pixel isometry.
